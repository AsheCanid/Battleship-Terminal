# Battleship-Terminal
A game of Battleship that runs natively in the terminal. This is for Linux, but a Windows fork will be available soon (Note that the program will run in either but the terminal will not operate correctly in Windows)
BSFuncs.h is a file that can be ommitted if the display function is added to the BattleShip.cpp file. It might gain morre functionality in the future as the project evolves.
